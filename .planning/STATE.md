## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Node.js 22 + Fastify 5 | Modern, fast HTTP layer; good WebSocket support via ws |
| PostgreSQL 16 + Drizzle ORM | Type-safe schema, migrations, reliable persistence |
| React 19 + Vite | Fast client build, modern UI framework |
| Caddy reverse proxy | Auto-TLS via Let's Encrypt, minimal config |
| Docker Compose deployment | Full self-hosted stack, easy to run on VPS |
| ws library for WebSocket | Lightweight, no abstraction overhead |

### Architecture Notes

- API server: Node.js 22 + Fastify 5
- WebSocket: ws library integrated with Fastify
- Database: PostgreSQL 16, accessed via Drizzle ORM
- File storage: Docker named volume (local filesystem)
- Reverse proxy: Caddy (handles TLS termination)
- Client: React 19 + Vite (SPA)
- Auth: JWT access tokens + refresh tokens, validated at WS handshake

### Todos

- (none yet)

### Blockers

- (none)
